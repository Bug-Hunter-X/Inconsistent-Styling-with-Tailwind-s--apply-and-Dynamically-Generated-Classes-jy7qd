The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a CSS class that's dynamically generated by JavaScript.  If the JavaScript code manipulates the CSS class string in a way that alters the order of the `@apply` directives, or if it adds/removes `@apply` directives, the result can be unpredictable and might lead to styling inconsistencies or errors. This happens because Tailwind processes `@apply` directives during the build process; dynamic manipulation of the CSS class strings after the build process bypasses this processing.

For example:
```javascript
// JavaScript code that dynamically adds a class
document.getElementById('myElement').classList.add('dynamic-class');
```
```css
/* CSS class with @apply directives */
.dynamic-class {
  @apply bg-gray-100 p-4;
  @apply text-xl;
}
```
If the JavaScript changes the class string to '.dynamic-class text-red-500' in the running application, Tailwind's build-time processing isn't aware of the new structure, potentially causing unintended styles.  The new style will not take precedence.
